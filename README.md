## Getting Started

1.  Fork and clone this repo.
2.  `npm install`.
3.  Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start-dev`. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute `npm start` and `npm run build-watch` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
4.  Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site in the browser.
