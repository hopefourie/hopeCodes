## Getting Started

1.  Fork and clone this repo.
2.  `npm install`.
3.  Create `hope-codes` database.
4.  Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start-dev`. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute `npm start` and `npm run build` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
5.  Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site in the browser.
6.  Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`. You will need to seed the database once you've set up the Sequelize models.
