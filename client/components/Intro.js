          <h2>Hello! I'm Hope Fourie, a full stack software engineer.</h2>
          <p>
            I originally studied design theory and execution at Wesleyan
            University, and used this knowledge to pursue a career in costume
            design for TV and film. I loved being creative at work, but I missed
            being analytical. When I started learning JS for the first time, I
            knew I had found what I was looking for. I love the creative problem
            solving aspect of coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a 17-week immersive coding bootcamp at Fullstack Academy, I am
            looking a job that links my design experience with my new
            engineering skills. I am excited to work on projects that I enjoyed
            creating and that are making othersâ€™ lives better.
